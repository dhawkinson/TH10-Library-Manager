# TH10-Library-Manager
Full Stack Java Script Project 10 - Treehouse TechDegree

A library management app with SQLite3 db,  the Sequelize ORM and the Express framework


The library.db file contains 3 tables. The tables are Books, Patrons and Loans (books lent). 

As a librarian, I should have a home screen so I can access functionality easily with a single click.

The home screen should include links to all of the following pages:

* Books:
  * New Book
  * List All
  * List Overdue
  * List Checked Out
* Patrons:
  * New Patron
  * List All
* Loans
  * New Loan
  * List All
  * List Overdue
  * List Checked Out

As a librarian, I should be able to access a main navigation menu from every page of my application.

Notifications

As a librarian, I should be able to be notified if any of the required fields in any given form have any missing data, so that I can correct the information.

## Extra Credit

To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

<ul><li>Include pagination for the loans and books listing pages.</li>
<li>Include search fields on at least one of the books or patrons listing pages.</li>
<ul><li>Examples:</li>
<li>first_name, last_name,library_id, etc for patrons</li>
 <li>title, author, genre, etc for books</li></ul></ul>

Searching should be case **insensitive** and be partial matches for strings.
